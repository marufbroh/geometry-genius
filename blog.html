        <h1>1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> DOM stands for Document Object Model. CSS and HTML are viewed as objects in JavaScript.
            JavaScript
            has access to any property of an object, so it converts HTML and CSS into a Document Object Model, so it can
            modify the document structure, style, and content as needed.</p>
